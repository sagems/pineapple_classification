# Using Tree Based Models and Sentinel 2 Data to Map Pineapple Plantations in Costa Rica 2020-2023
Sage McGinley-Smith and Hannah Norman 

Winter 2024 

In this repository, you can find all code files for the project. Most code was written in Python in Google Collab, sometimes using the Google Earth Engine API (https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/intro-to-python-api). This includes code for collecting traning data, cleaning traning data, exporting raw Sentinel data from Google Enrth Engine, building models, and making the predictions. There are also two files that were not ultimately used in the creation of the datasets, but represent an investigation into the application of deep learning and neural nets to this problem. Although neither were used, the Unet file has been configured such that it could potentially be applied in a future project with more time and resources. There is also an R file used for raster visualizations and a pdf containing the only Google Earth Engine code that was written directly in the terminal and not in the Python API.  

In addition to the code, this repository contains all of the final predictions, in visual format and raster format, all of the traning data in csv format and as shapefiles, and our midterm and final report. The raw Sentinel data files that the predictions were made on were too large to include but can pre provided upon request by emailing sagems@stanford.edu. The labeled data from CeNAT is not publicly accessible, but is accessible via Sage's Google Earth Engine account. Although that data is not included, the pathways to the private GEE assets are included in the traning data collection files. 


Finally, the final prediction rasters, as well as visualizations for them, can be found in the Final Predictions folder.
